<h1 align="center">Cryptocurrencies</h1>

## Overview
The purpose of this project is to use Pandas to process the cryptocurrency dataset and then perform Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with it.

## Description of the Analysis
After data were cleaned and processed, I used the K-means algorithm to create an elbow curve using hvPlot to find the best value for K, which was 4. I then ran the K-means algorithm to predict the 4 clusters for the cryptocurrenciesâ€™ data. To visualize the result, I used Plotly Express and hvplot to show the clusters.
